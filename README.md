#UEFA Champions League Matches Analysis (2025–2026)
##Project Description

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on UEFA Champions League matches from the 2025–2026 season. The goal is to clean the dataset, analyze match statistics, and extract meaningful insights about team performance, match outcomes, and statistical trends.

##Objectives
Clean and preprocess football match data
Analyze team performance and match statistics
Identify patterns in match outcomes
Prepare the dataset for possible future predictive modeling

##Dataset Information
The dataset contains match-level information such as match date, home and away teams, scores, venue details, passing accuracy, shots on target, saves, and other performance-related statistics.

##Data Preprocessing
Loaded dataset using Pandas
Converted date columns into datetime format
Converted categorical columns into category datatype
Removed unnecessary or redundant columns
Handled missing values using mean (numerical) and mode (categorical)

##Exploratory Data Analysis
Team performance comparison
Goals and match result analysis
Passing accuracy trends
Shots on target and match statistics evaluation
Visualization of match trends using graphs

##Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
